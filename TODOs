BUGS


Basically two completely non working systems
    - userauth no longer works after persistnat storage due to confusion between sql liate and mongo modalities
    - midi player does not work wiht inport 
    - mp3 player does not allow multiople instanced of player 
    - gpt keeps giving junk code

music flow should work as follows
    - midi player is loaded
    - midi player interprets midi and triggers cube movements and highlighting sequences
    - MP3 plyer plays at same time as midi

user auth flow should work as follows
    - user clicks login to metmask
    - if not authed- gives starting balance
    - user can claim items, this subtracts some starting balance
    - once user claims 

BIG issues
    - don't understand how require or modules work properly in Node
    - database logic collision for user


IDEAS

add beethoven bust 


link to other spaces


upon visit pay owner of cube

do a zoom at multiple depths  <-- have GPT code


improper idea of coordinates
    - cube numbers and location need to be persistant (i.e should be numbered from center out) 

add other types of music and auto transpose (like the japanese flute library)
 - mabye to midi 

"discoverable items"



DONE

refactor terminal or add more classic logic


add persistant data source   <-done but garbage from GPT needs clean up


make play journey mark and be multiplayer <-- works but plays back on local machine so you get duplicates. need to de-dupe.


Mikowski space? 


allow users to edit content of their cubes (can change label)


re-center hypercube


build tone map so you can play specific music

"play" music by feeding a melody then move the user from place to corresponding place

deploy to a server wehre people can get it at it

add some other login or web association
