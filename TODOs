can't find the source of that annoying sound when you click on a cube!

zoom  -- all zoom functions so far look meh or confusing

jargon live loading and parsing 
    - auto populating (requires extension) 
    - auto testing
    - text prompt in terminal
    
click on image, poem comes out

USABILITY BUGS

all journeys play on their own loop


BUGS


Cube also not moving highlight system properly

Basically two completely non working systems
    - userauth no longer works after persistant storage due to confusion between sql lite and mongo modalities
    - midi player does not work with inport 
    - gpt keeps giving junk code


user auth flow should work as follows
    - user clicks login to metmask
    - if not authed- gives starting balance
    - user can claim items, this subtracts some starting balance
    - once user claims 

BIG issues
    - don't understand how require or modules work properly in Node
    - database logic collision for user


SYNTAX WISHlIsT

g /3.2.3//1.3.3-3s/ 

go to 3.2.3, shift orientation towars 1.3.3 over 3seconds

map "chopin"->play chopin;2,3,3,4,55,66

1.3.3
1.3.2/claim
- message "reserved"  to eth_address
1.2.2/create "pizza in space" 
2.3.3/create/game "everyone picks their own elephant, biggest one wins" <-- must be implementable in three js in 1-2 function calls <-- can functions be called uplon load 
1.2.3->water->2.3.4  (velocity vectors)
g23.2 (adjust gravity) 
WL["  "] import wolfram intepreter object, unique gemoetryes
C["object name"] create ojbect
clean 20 -- cleaing up oldest 20% of objects
group[molecules][33 bpm] - group all molecules nad give them a 33 bpm movement rate

IDEAS


tag

hide and seek

conways game of life in cubes, syncronized to music
   -https://github.com/fractastical/game-of-life-threejs
   -GPT4 also wrote code

add beethoven bust - maybe voxelized version (generated a veew versions) 

upon visit pay owner of cube

do a zoom at multiple depths  <-- have GPT code (and more code ut still doesn't work)

"discoverable items"


DONE

improper idea of coordinates
    - cube numbers and location need to be persistant (i.e should be numbered from center out) 

link to other spaces -- c.f. SPace 


add other types of music and auto transpose (like the japanese flute library)
 - mabye to midi 


network state simulation visualizations 


MAJOR Bugs 
need to bring all JS libraries local so not hammered by low latency internet DONE 

can't stop music FIXED 
some of the camera gets stuck after journey and won't move FIXED
can't play subsequent journey  FIXED

music flow should work as follows
    - midi player is loaded
    - midi player interprets midi and triggers cube movements and highlighting sequences
    - MP3 plyer plays at same time as midi
[ decision may be to abandon MIDI in favor of winamp like system - partially implemented]


- mp3 player does not allow multiople instanced of player 

refactor terminal or add more classic logic


add persistant data source   <-done but garbage from GPT needs clean up


make play journey mark and be multiplayer <-- works but plays back on local machine so you get duplicates. need to de-dupe.


Mikowski space? 


allow users to edit content of their cubes (can change label)


re-center hypercube


build tone map so you can play specific music

"play" music by feeding a melody then move the user from place to corresponding place

deploy to a server wehre people can get it at it

add some other login or web association
