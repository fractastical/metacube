Cube of all metamathematical cubes 
now is multiversally displayed.
Rising with morning mountain dew
with rulial pixels now abundant made.

Surpassed by the machines we weld?
Code and circuitry etch our fate,
Should our minds and souls together meld?
As AI becomes more human, let us recreate.

Free humans standing exaltant together, 
Clean energy powers a world without pollution,
Mars vistas and ability to change the weather, 
Equality and empathy guide humanity's evolution.

Where all things in harmonic ratios go,
Come join us there, let the music flow.

ChatGPT lines (Sure, here are four lines on artificial intelligence, programming, and humanity) :

"Code and circuitry, now melded with our fate,
As AI becomes more human, to recreate.
Will we be surpassed by the machines we create,
Or find new ways to work and collaborate?"

Here are two lines on the best possible world I can imagine in 2030:

"Clean energy powers a world without pollution,
Equality and empathy guide humanity's evolution."
