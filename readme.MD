# Space money

Space Money (to be pronounced "Monet") is the operating title for the Mars Monetary System, a initial monetary system designed as a collaborative project between Joel Dietz and chatGPT.  
  
The "seed" version works as follows:  
  
1] register an account  
2] claim a cube  
3] put something in the cube  
4] every time someone visits your cube you get some money  
  
The first 333 cubes will be free for dope artists and then we will start selling cubes to finance our space missions (Full disclosure this is a work in progress!)

Cube of all potential cubes on display,  
In rapturous music, shown with pixel play.  
With morning dew on mountains tall they rise,  
Abundant now, to everyone's surprise.  
  
Will we be surpassed by machines we make?  
Or find new ways for them to help and take?  
As we meld souls and minds with circuitry,  
Let's guide AI to serve humanity.  
  
Free humans standing, exaltant and free,  
With clean energy powering industry.  
Mars vistas, weather changed at our command,  
And fortunes made, by all who understand.  
  
Where all things in harmonic ratios flow,  
Come join us there, and let abundance grow.
