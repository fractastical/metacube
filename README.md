# Metajargon

This is a jargon-based terminal application for rendering ai generated visual logic and games. It has been merged from the metalambda.org spec which contains a url-like coordinate system for addressing and inserting objects in 3d space (/3.4.5/i/pizza.glb). "Game" here is use in a general to refer to all systems that depends on logical rules that can be implemented computationally and have associated quantifiable metrics (also referred to as "qnomic").
