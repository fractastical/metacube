# Multiversal Sonnet 0.11


Cube of all potential cubes on display,  
In rapturous music, shown with pixel play.  
With morning dew on mountains tall they rise,  
Abundant now, to everyone's surprise.  
  
Will we be surpassed by machines we make?  
Or find new ways for them to help and take?  
As we meld souls and minds with circuitry,  
Let's guide AI to serve humanity.  
  
Free humans standing, exaltant and free,  
With clean energy powering industry.  
Mars vistas, weather changed at our command,  
And fortunes made, by all who understand.  
  
Where all things in harmonic ratios flow,  
Come join us there, and let abundance grow.
