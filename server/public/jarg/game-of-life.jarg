+++ metagame("Life: The Text-Based Adventure")

Create a text-based adventure game that simulates life with the following rules and mechanics:
Player starts with zero memory.
Time moves forward, never backward.
Artifacts (memories, items) can be collected, but may disappear at any time.
Core artifacts (name, location) are semi-permanent.
Player can perform actions at each step, consuming time.
Player has a body requiring energy replenishment through food and sleep.
Player chooses their own winning condition, which may or may not be verifiable.
Media types (talking, reading, watching, etc.) can be used to load past game states into memory.
Standard and rare media types exist to explore.
Various conditions can end the player's life (starvation, disease, people, animals).
Rules and world mechanics must be discovered.
If the winning condition is not achieved upon death, the game resets to zero.
