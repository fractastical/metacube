+++ metagame($game_name)

Determine if it is possible to implement the given game in a single JavaScript function with less than 50 lines of JavaScript code, assuming there is already an active three.js scene, and all that is needed is the game logic implementation.
If it is possible, provide the jargon code for the game and JavaScript function.
If it is not possible, explain that the implementation is out of scope due to the line constraint.
